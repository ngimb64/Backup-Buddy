## Prereqs
> This program was written on Python 3.9, but should work on most versions of 3. 

## Installation
- Look up python in search engine and install
- Open up command prompt, traverse to program directory, & execute

## Purpose
> This tool makes keeping an updated backup of different systems a breeze.
> It takes a source & destination path to then either copy or update data.
> If the data doesn't exist it is automatically copied.
> If the data already exist the source & destination files last modified timestamps are compared.
> If the the source file has a more recent last modified timestamp .. the destination is updated accordingly.
> There are also built in srcDoc/destDock  directories that can be utilized by simply hitting enter then providing an absolute path.
